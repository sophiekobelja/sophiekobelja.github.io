<h2>System Concept Statement</h2>
<p>
The Virginia Tech Interactive Museum Experience (VT IMEX) is a system that allows Virginia Tech museum curators to create interactive, meaningful, and informative experiences for museum visitors. The system will offer a method for attaching digital media to physical objects, as well as a method for visitors to access this media alongside the physical object. VT IMEX will solve the issue of the limited informative and interactive properties of traditional museum displays. This system will create an experience for visitors that creates a memorable museum visit that provides a lasting impact on their connection with the world.

<h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>


<strong>Preparation</strong>
<div style="margin-left: 20px">
  <br>
  The first step we took in our process of gathering work data was identifying where we would collect that data. We decided that with the topic of our project, we would want to gain insight from both visitors to museums and staff that curates them. This would provide data not just for what the average person finds meaningful when they visit museums, but what the users who would use our system find useful or important when creating the experiences for the visitors. Museum exhibits are, after all, a human product with hours of work put into them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Our group decided to conduct a total of three interviews - two with visitors, and one with a curator. The two visitors interviewed were visitors to two different museums. One was a science museum located in Baltimore, Maryland, and the other was a cultural museum in Seattle, Washington. The curator interviewed is the curator of Virginia Tech’s Corps of Cadets museum, a historical museum. These three were decided upon as they would provide a wide range of perspectives on how museums currently provide engaging experiences to visitors across different subject matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Along with the interviews, our group visited various museums to gain first-hand knowledge of how information is presented to visitors. These were the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum and Smithsonian Design Museum. We also visited the Virginia Tech Museum of Geosciences as a group during the contextual inquiry process. As with the interviews, these selections gave us a wide-range in terms of scope. The Air & Space Museum, for example, is vast with a plethora of interactive activities. The Virginia Tech Museum of Geosciences takes up a single lab-sized room in Derring Hall, with only a couple interactive options. Through this, we would be able to gain information on what a museum can offer with a large amount of space and funding, as well as limited resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  While more interviews and visits and observational inquiry would be desirable, the amount of contextual inquiry we took on was as much as seemed reasonable for our group’s available resources. The main limiter was time and distance. Blacksburg only offers a handful of physical museums to be able to visit, and it is rather difficult to arrange interviews or work practice observation without prior connections in the related fields.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Process</strong>
  <br>
  <div style="margin-left:20px">
    The interviews took place independently. As a group, we came up with separate interview questions for visitors and curators. These were then taken by the team members performing the interviews and conducted as parties were available and willing. Our interview notes were then aggregated to a shared space for team review and discussion.

<br>
Raw contextual data was collected via museum visits. The primary one was the Virginia Tech Museum of Geosciences. As a group, we explored this museum for every detail. We took notes and pictures of most displays in the museum, with a focus on interactive objects. We also made note of how a visitor is supposed to interact with the exhibits, and how a visitor actually interacts with them. The display of contextual information related to the exhibits to the visitor was another area of interest in our visits, along with any methods that expand the availability of information beyond the physical display in the museum space (e.g. links to Internet resources). This provided us with valuable information regarding what current work practice in terms of user interaction at a small museum is like.

  <strong>1. Interviews</strong>
  <br>
  <strong>Interview about the EMP museum:</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What was your favorite exhibit and why?</strong>
  <br>
  The horror movie section was really cool. I enjoyed seeing the analysis of different genres and seeing the actual items used in the movies
  <br>
   
  <strong>What kept you engaged the most at the museum?</strong>
  <br>
  There were these recording studios that different instruments - a drum set, guitars, a bass, a microphone, and you could get a 15 minute turn in the room at a time. So my friends and I ended up spending 2 hours going in and out of the studios playing music
  <br>
  <strong>Why do you think it was able to keep you engaged?</strong>
  <br>
  I love playing music so having all the instruments there and a space to jam in was great. Definitely having the hands on part made it enjoyable
  <br>
  <strong>Talk about some other exhibits you enjoyed.</strong>
  <br>
  There was an awesome exhibit on a lot of different bands from the 90s, like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, some others. Learning about their history was really interesting, they had pages with original lyrics Kurt Cobain wrote. They also had listening stations where you could listen to different songs from the bands they were talking about.

  <strong>Interview at the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets museum</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  Samantha is the curator for the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets museum. I (Emmet) met with her for an interview to discuss her work.
  <br>
  <strong>How do most artifacts come into the museum’s collection?</strong>
  <br>
  Majority donated by alummi. Alumni usually initiate donation. Seems to be currently the Corps is reaching out more.
  <br>
  <strong>What goes into determining the value of an object to the collection?</strong>
  <br>
  Always keep the mission statement in the front part of the brain. Can't just be whatever you think is cool. Archiving and keeping is expensive. Once you take something, you tell them you're taking stewardship. If it’s not worth it, it’s a waste of money.
  <br>
  VT Corps Museum Mission statement is in the works
  <br>
  Accessioning is what it's called. Deaccess is taking it out.
  <br>

  <strong>How much material is on display?</strong>
  <br>
  In any collection, only about 40% is on display
  <br>
  <strong>What is the decision making process like when considering an exhibit?</strong>
  <br>
  Look at audience, relevance to mission, that day and current events are important, and underlying agenda (usually education)
  <br>
  <strong>When creating a display, what goes into consideration in terms of organization and arrangement?</strong>
  <br>
  Thematically, chronologically are the two typical ways. It has to be ey-catching; it's subjective. "More than bang, you have to have buck." Can't just be pretty stuff, has to be ugly and important stuff.
  <br>

  <strong>How do you determine theme vs chrono?</strong>
  <br>
       Subject matter, how many objects are available to support that display
       Some are just "meant" to be displayed one way or another
  <br>

  <strong>Is there any information or historical context that is often left behind in a physical display?</strong>
  <br>
  Everything is limited - space, time. Have to decide what will underscore your story or what you're trying to get across. Lots of stories are being told that are rich in content, and have to decide how to impart with an object, AND text. Many thoughts on text, but big agreement is too much is very much a bad thing. Short and meaningful, and more avenues like the internet to add more value. "Like a card with web addresses to visit." Can't cram everything into one showcase.
  <br>
  <strong>What information do you think museum goers are most interested in when visiting?</strong>
  <br>
  Not really. People don't often visit or go to the temporary museum. The few who do are corps alumni who visit to reminisce. 
  <br>
  <strong>How do you market the museum, or increase its visibility?</strong>
  <br>
      Not much marketing. Just started redoing showcases in this transition period. Some social media use, and in person contact with alumni.
  <br>
  <strong>What sorts of common tools or design elements do you use when creating an physical exhibit?</strong>
  <br>
  Can't lump all objects into one visual language.
  <br>
  <strong>Interconnecting exhibits/displays?</strong>
  <br>
  Example - an exhibit about a cadet's freshman year. Need to give visual guidance.
  <br>
  <strong>Is there a specific order you want people to experience the museum?</strong>
  <br>
  "That's not my school of thought." It all needs to be synthesized and cohesive. Should be able to look into an exhibit at any point and gain something valuable. Every object should stand on its own and be meaningful.
  <br>
  <strong>Do you use any system, tools, etc., that allow visitors to learn more information beyond what’s physically at the museum?</strong>
  <br>
      No, not right now. Plans are in the works to change that. The physical space currently does not allow it. (mentions brochures, says they'd just get taken). Too Expensive to put anything technological.
  <br>
  <strong>Is there anything else you want to say about maintaining a museum collection?</strong>
  <br>
      "Museums should always be collecting and striving to find new stories to fulfill their mission." Makes it more interesting. There should be a reason to keep going back to the museum. Otherwise it's a "glorified closet".
      "There's a lot more to putting out something and making it look cool than just making it look cool."
  <br>

  <strong>Maryland science museum:</strong>
  <br>
  <strong>What brings you to the museum?</strong>
  <br>
  I was already visiting the aquarium and the museum was here also so we decided to visit the museum as well
  <br>
  <strong>How did you hear about this exhibit?</strong>
  <br>
  There was a baltimore harbor guide map at the aquarium and the museum was prominently listed
  <br>
  <strong>What were your favorite things about the exhibit?</strong>
  <br>
  I Liked the bed of nails and the infrared harp because I got to play around with the display
  <br>
  <strong>What were your least favorite things about the exhibit?</strong>
  <br>
  The dinosaur bones weren't as hands on as the other floors and I don't like archeology in general
  <br>
  <strong>How in-depth do you want to be informed of the pieces in the exhibit?</strong>
  <br>
  As informed as I can.  I really like the technology exhibits and liked learning how they worked
  <br>
  <strong>What did you have questions about that you were unable to get an answer to while visiting the museum?</strong>
  <br>
  There was a presentation about chemistry.  There was a large crowd so i couldn't get my questions asked.  I don’t remember what they were in particular.  Everything else was pretty clear.
  <br>
  <strong>Have you been here before</strong>
  <br>
  I've been here before a few years ago but remember a lot of the stuff here.  I was wondering if they changed much
  <br>
  <strong>What kind of person do you think would enjoy the exhibit?</strong>
  <br>
  Someone who likes science in general
  <br>
  <strong>Do you plan on visiting the museum again?</strong>
  <br>
  If they announced a lot of new things I might go back.  the drive isn't that long from my house
  <br>
  <strong>What exhibits bored you? Why did they bore you?</strong>
  <br>
  The dinosaur exhibit because i'm not too interested in them and I couldn’t play around with the display like other areas

<h2>Contextual Analysis</h2>


<strong>Final description/understanding of the overall picture</strong>
<br>
From our findings we learned a lot of information. By interviewing many candidates who visited interactive museums and researching about interactive museums, we noticed that interactive museums enhance the user experience. Activities that target senses (touch, hearing, visual displays comprised of a lot of graphics and many colors) help the user remember the experience. People are also more engaged when they have something to take back with them, such as notes about each exhibit/what they have learned. Notes are good for learning the material. Pictures are great for remembering the memory and recollecting the exhibits. Videos are good for memories and learning information. Souvenirs are great for memories because they’re good reminders of the museum. Group activities are fantastic in that they engage the visitor in conversations about the topic, which enriches their learning experience. The three step process is a great way to affect visitors; notice importance, reach them through senses, and help them take memories back with them. These things are crucial for an interactive experience. Overall, the purpose of a museum is to educate visitors, and the more interactive a museum is, the more likely that the visitors will retain the information. 
<br>


<h2>Work Activity Notes</h2>

<strong>Outreach/PR:</strong>
<br>
We grouped together some notes into an outreach/PR group because they all pertained to what a museum needs to do to get publicity and the results of that publicity. By evaluating the pros and cons of this list, we can reach a conclusion on how publicity can be improved in the Blacksburg museums.
<br>
<strong>Overall museum design</strong>
<br>
We created this group because they talked about good and bad designs of the museums. This will be useful in applying to overall design decisions.
<br>
<strong>Process to create a display</strong>
<br>
We all had some notes on the process of creating a display. These apply to the interactivity of the display based on how it is organized.
<strong>Technologies</strong>
<br>
This section is all of our notes on the different technologies used in the interactive museums.
<br>
<strong>User responses</strong>
<br>
This was the longest section of the WAAD. This is because how the user responds to a museum, both positively and negatively, are very important in evaluating the overall success of its interactivity. 
<br>
<strong>Interactive Activities</strong>
<br>
This section highlights all of the different interactive activities provided at different museums. We decided to make this section so we could group together the pros and cons of interactive activities and apply these to our analysis.
<br>
<strong>Audience</strong>
<br>
This section focuses on the audience the interactive museums cater to.
<br>
<strong>Educating Visitors </strong>
<br>
This is an important section because museums’ purpose are to educate visitors, so evaluating successful interactive museums’ education is useful.
<br>
<strong>Expanding content</strong>
<br>
How the museum goers themselves feel might change their decision to go back

    The flow model can be separated into four different components:
    <br>
    Exhibits - this includes the creation of the museum exhibits, the setup and logistics of the exhibits, and the organization of different events to entice people to come to the museum. The exhibit creator designs the different exhibits and ensures their high level of interactivity.
    <br>
    Advertising - this encompasses all parts of the work domain involved in informing the audience about what is going on in the museum. Those working in advertising make sure to draw our audience in to the museum.
    <br>
    Operations - this includes all employees involved in keeping the business stable, such as managing its financials, running the day to day operations, dealing with customer issues, etc. 
    <br>
    Sales - this includes all portions of the work domain involved in generating revenue for the museum. The website makes it simple for customers to buy tickets, the ticket sellers give tickets to the customers, the ticket buyers supply the revenue to the museum.
    <br>
    All of these four components come together to create a complex system as modeled in our flow diagram.
