The analysis phase of our project focused on primarily Blacksburg’s museums. With the results of our contextual inquiry and analysis, we had a large amount of useful data. It also became apparent that a further refinement of our scope would be beneficial, and lead to an improved design for this phase. We decided to focus our efforts on designing a system for the Virginia Tech Museum of Geosciences. We selected this museum due to its educational opportunities inherent in its material, its physical proximity, and team members’ collective familiarity with it. From here, the design process itself allowed us to tailor our focus further.

<h2>Primary Persona</h2>
<br>
<img src="photos/persona.png" class="image">
<br>
<p>
Our primary design persona is Luke Johnson, a 16 year old junior at Blacksburg High School. He is a quarterback on the football team who spends a lot of time with his friends and not much with academics; science is his least favorite subject. Luke is required to visit the Museum of Geosciences for class and has to document his findings. This task is difficult since he is easily bored by scientific concepts and dry presentations and thinks museums are lame.
</p>
<br>
<p>
We chose this persona because we think this is going to be the toughest demographic to target. Younger children are much easier to keep entertained, so if we are able to engage a 16 year old who has no interest in museums or science, our new system can appeal to anyone. 
16 year old boys are usually required to go to a museum (school field trips, etc.); to promote learning for them, they need a lot of fun and interaction. Their rebelliousness and disinterest in learning experiences such as museums make them the primary candidate to target because gaining their interest will likely also gain interest of secondary candidates.

<h2>User Activities and Tasks</h2>
  <br>
  Education - need to teach visitor new information, or new approaches to old information
  <br>
  Hands-on interaction - visitors have direct control over aspects of system
  <br>
  Offers “newness” - visitors are more interested in unique, novel things in museums
  <br>
  Feedback - visitors should be able to provide feedback to the museum curation staff
  <br>
  Social activity - users of the app should be able to compare their score with friends, and share their experiences

<h2>Ideation and Sketching</h2>
<br>
<p>
For our ideation process, we thought of different exhibits and activities we encountered at the Museum of Geosciences and how we can apply augmented reality to them. For instance, one of the activities we came up with was an interactive mineral display. Instead of just having information on a sign next to a rock in the museum, the user now points their tablet’s camera view towards the rock and can learn about the rock, view a map of where it was found, zoom in and look at molecular and crystal structure, and link to related minerals. At the museum we found paper handouts for a scavenger hunt, so another idea is a scavenger hunt that incorporates augmented reality. The sketching process goes hand in hand with ideation. Once we come up with an idea that we think has value, we discuss how it would look and feel and quickly generate a sketch to communicate our ideas further among each other.
</p>
<br>
<strong>Interactive digging earth demonstration:</strong>
<br>
<p>
  Have a character on an interactive touch screen display who digs into the earth.  Within different layers of the earth the user has multiple event options which can mix together to create different types of rocks. E.g. on layer 2 a volcano goes off and mixes with water to form rock a.  But if the user does not set  off the volcano the water pressure on the earth creates rock b. (use actual rocks and examples)
</p>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Interactive mineral display</strong>
<br>
Users would be able to select specimens they’ve found in the museum and learn more about them
<br>
Can zoom in and look at molecular, crystal structure
<br>
Can view a map of where the specimen was found
<br>
Pull up a list of its traits and raw data
<br>
Links to related minerals
<br>
<br>
Augmented reality scavenger hunt
<br>
Explore the museum space with “objectives” to complete
<br>
E.g. “collect this rock”, “do this activity”, “find X number of specimens with this characteristic”
<br>
Clues point towards hidden objectives
<br>
Physical displays should offer a way to use the phone to interact with the application
<br>
Age/difficulty settings
<br>
Timed completion to keep scores
<br>
Link w/ social media to compare with friends
<br>
<br>
<strong>Interactive mining adventure</strong>
<br>
This interaction will be point-based. 
<br>
Users will be given a handheld device (or download app, etc) that will keep track of their interactions
<br>
The interaction will utilize spatial and handheld augmented reality
<br>
Different parts of the museum will provide various “environments” where the user can mine for different kinds of rocks--each of these interactions will provide information on the region that the user is mining in, what kind of rocks they are looking for
<br>
Different sections will be organized by geographic region as well as by era 
<br>
Different kinds of rocks warrant different point values
<br>
The spatial augmented reality will allow for several users to interact at once 
<br>
Collected rocks are virtual, but the physical rocks will be displayed in each section, allowing for a tangible view of the rock and a more engaged interest because of the users’ personal experience in collecting such rock 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Minecraft mod/augmented reality exploring minerals and layers of the earth</strong>
<br>
Take the minecraft engine and tie it to geology giving more realistic materials and a way to observe them
<br>
<br>
<strong>Interactive stream simulator with augmented reality</strong>
<br>
Could show the development of something like the Grand Canyon over time, understand how the water interacts with the rock 
<br>
Can look at different canyons/rivers, specifically rivers local to the user’s area
<br>
Not a game, just an observational activity
<br>
Slide bar to see the state of the rivers in a certain point of time
<br>
<br>

<h2>Designer Mental Model</h2>
<strong>What the system is</strong>
<br>
Our system is an interactive app for smartphones that visitors to museums can download and use. It offers a new way of absorbing information at a museum. It presents the physical museum space as a space full of knowledge that must be collected and synthesized by the user.
<br>
In the form of a scavenger hunt, a user is presented with a list of objectives to be completed, which are set by museum staff. Users complete this scavenger hunt and their score is kept which they can share with their friends.
<br>
There are two main portions to the system - the user side and the museum side. The 
user side is presented via a smartphone app, which contains information and status relevant to the user (available objectives, completed objectives, score, etc). The museum side is a combination of physical markers in the museum and the museum curated activities which these markers activate when interacted with by the user.
<br>

<h2>Conceptual Design</h2>
<strong>Workspace:</strong>
Our workspace was the computer science lounge. We worked at a large table and had paper and pens for sketching and a whiteboard for organizing ideas. 
<br><br>

<strong>Ecological conceptual design</strong>
<br>
The mobile application will be available on both users personal devices and on museum provided devices
<br>
The provided tablet will be designed for use by all age grips. Shown below:
<br>
<br>

<img src="photos/ecological_persp.JPG" class="waad_image">
<br><br>

The tablet will have a rear-facing camera for augmented reality features
<br>
The tablet will have a grip/protective case to accommodate younger children, and a strap to allow kids to wear the device around their neck or shoulder and be hands-free
<br>
The museum displays are visibly identified with markers which can be scanned by devices with the app installed
<br>
Markers are a mix of scannable QR codes and NFC tags
<Br>
The user manually initiates scanning via the app
<br>
Objectives must be selected by user on the app first before interacting with the marker to prevent simply scanning each one found and hoping it completes an objective
<br>
The app interacts with third-party social media to share data the user wishes to share regarding their experience with the app
<br>
There is a feature within the app to leave feedback, which is accessible to museum curation staff via the software they use to manage the system
<br>
<img src="photos/conceptual1.jpg" class="waad_image">
<br>
<strong>Emotional conceptual design</strong>
<br>
The app will be able to tailor itself to a user’s preferred difficulty setting
<br>
This is selected upon opening the app, but user can switch at any time during their usage in the app
<br>
Museum staff can manage how each setting affects the available activities within the app
<br>
Keeps users in ideal middle ground between bored and frustrated with the challenge level, maximizing positive response
<br>
Museums can control graphics and “look & feel” based on difficulty settings, so easier ones for kids can be more colorful and bright to allow for an engaging and happy experience
<br>
When an objective or activity is completed, the user is notified of their increased score and presented with a message of encouragement
<br>
<br>
<img src="photos/conceptual2.jpg" class="waad_image">
<br>
Completed objectives remain visible on the app, providing a sense of progression and accomplishment
<br>
<br>
A user’s current score is visible on the main screen at all times, allowing an easy view of their progress through the activities at a glance
<br>
Users will be able to take a culminating quiz after they’ve completed a certain number of objectives. Successfully passing this quiz will permanently mark that user’s profile with a medal of accomplishment, and the museum can offer a prize for this at their discretion.
<br>
App allows users to share their score and progress on social media networks
<br>
App can also connect to social media and find friend’s/follower’s scores to compare their achievements
<br>
Allows comparisons, competition between friends, encouraging continued use of the app in a positive way
<br>
<br>
<strong>Interaction conceptual design</strong>
<br>
App informs the user upon first activation with basic instructions on how to proceed (how to complete objectives, what to look for, etc)
<br>
User is presented with a checklist upon beginning the scavenger hunt with a list of available objectives
<br>
The objectives can be completed in any order
<br>
Each is designed by museum staff to highlight information the curator finds suitable for a specific age group
<br>
Can simply be finding specific marker(s) in the museum, completing an activity through the app, or mix of the two
<br>
Checklist allows user to keep track of both completed objectives and opportunities available
<br>
App has built-in features to run graphical applications via a common platform (Unity, Flash)
<br>
These integrated applications can be set to be available at any time, or only run upon completion of specific objectives
<br>
Allows extensibility for museum curators to design their own personal methods of presenting information and allowing interaction between museum and visitor without restrictions of physical space
<br>
System offers quizzes (designed by museum staff) after user has completed enough objectives in scavenger hunt
<br>
Users are alerted that they can via pop-up once enough points have been accumulated that this is available
<br>
App keeps track of a user’s collected artifacts and activities, accessible via the app menu
<br>
User can go back and look up information on physical objects and displays they’ve found in their scavenger hunt and otherwise, as well as play activities/games to which these objects are linked
<br>
<br>
<strong>Our conceptual design links our broad mental model of how the system is envisioned to a concrete, physical implementation. It does this by providing explicit parameters for what features are available and how the system will direct users to use these features. It also lays out the notifications the system will use inform users of changing state. This shifts the user’s cognitive process from having to figure out how to use the app to actually learning via their interaction with the museum.</strong>
